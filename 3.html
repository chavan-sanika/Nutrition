<h1><center><i>FOOD HAS ALL THE HEALING POWER</i></center></h1>
<p>
This website is singlehandedly handled by Geeta Seth as her passion is to understand the clients very own personal body type and metabolism. 
She believes in diet designing as in-spite of being the same height, weight and age; the person still needs different diets to suit his/ her body type.
With the proper knowledge and history of the patient along with the health history of his/ her parents, Geeta designs the diet. 
Suppose the patients, parents or one of the parent is a diabetic, 
then Geeta puts the patient on a low glycemic index carbs and hurriedly reduces his/ her weight along with post meals short walks,
 so that the patient has no carbohydrate load on the body to get into the mode of pre-diabetes.
</p>

<p>
Geeta believes why diet designing is personal as one can see that for one person drinking milk daily makes him/ her feel energetic, light and
 encourages better sleep and at the same time another person taking milk can have stomach upset, feels drowsy and develops gases.
 So, the same diet does not work for two different persons.
</p>

<p>
Geeta Seth's diets are scientifically designed, and different for each person. 
For one person's bread can bring energy, for another it can give a hyper insulin reaction yet for another it can accelerate fat deposition.
